"""TemporalGAN Generator Version 2
In this version I use a dual stream for encoding part, which fuses the Sentiel2_T1 with Sentinel1_T2.
Attention
--------
For the attention we use
    * The Squeeze and Excitation from CBAM module before the fusion of the two streams(before the bottleneck).
    * The Position Attention Module(PAM) for the 128x128, 64x64, 32x32, and 16x16 layers.
    * CBAM for the 8x8, 4x4 layers, but only for the skip connection, the normal data gets donwsampled.

# Whats new since V2?
in this version, instead of first convolution downsampling layer, we use a convoluiton layer with no downsampling,
this will ouput a 256x256 tensor after the first convolution layer, the rest of the architecture is the same as V2.
removing the first downsampling layer, will result in every layer to be 2 times bigger than the previous version.
for exapmle out buttleneck input is 4x4 instead of 2x2, and the output of the bottle neck which is the smallest tesnor,
will be a 2x2 tensor instead of 1x1 tensor.

* for the skip connection, of the first layer, we use PAM but with the downsample parameter set to 2, for RAM conservation.
* since the second layer(128x128) now has more chnnels, the RAM usage was high, so I added downsaple to pam2 as well.
