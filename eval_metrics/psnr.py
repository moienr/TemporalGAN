    Args
    ---
        compare_tensors (Sequence[torch.Tensor]): A sequence of two tensors (y and y_pred) representing the batches of images to compare. 
            Both tensors must have shape (B, C, H, W).
        weight_map (torch.Tensor, optional): The weight map. Must have the same Batch size, H and W as `y` tesnor but channel could be either 1 or the same as `y` 
        max_val (float, optional): The maximum value of the pixels. Defaults to 1. Example: for `uint8` images, 
            it should be 255.

    Returns
    ---
        float: The mean PSNR value between each pair of images in the batches based on the weight map.

    Raises
    ---
        ValueError: If `compare_tensors` and `weight_map` have different shapes, or if they are not 4D tensors with
            the expected shapes.
